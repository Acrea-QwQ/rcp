# 🧭 Quarto Cross-Referencing and `.gitignore` Workshop

In this workshop, you’ll learn:

1. How to cross-reference sections, figures, code chunks, and tables in Quarto.
2. How to use a `.gitignore` file to keep unnecessary files out of your Git repository.

---

```{r}
#| echo: true

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```

## ✍️ Part 1: Cross-Referencing in Quarto

Quarto lets you easily refer to other parts of your document, like code, figures, and sections — just like in academic papers.

Let’s walk through some examples using the `palmerpenguins` dataset.

---

### 🔗 1. Referencing Sections

Any heading can be cross-referenced by adding an ID to it:

```markdown
## Data Cleaning {#sec-cleaning}
```

Now you can refer to it elsewhere like this:

```markdown
See Section @sec-cleaning for details on how the data was prepared.
```

---


### 🖼️ 2. Referencing Figures
To reference a figure, give it a label and caption:

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-bill
#| fig-cap: "Bill length vs flipper length"
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point()
```

Then reference it:

```markdown
Figure @fig-bill shows the relationship between flipper length and bill length.
```

### 📊 4. Referencing Tables
You can also label tables:

```{{r}}
#| label: tbl-summary
#| tbl-cap: "Summary statistics of the penguins dataset"
knitr::kable(summary(penguins))
```

Then refer to it like this:

```markdown
See Table @tbl-summary for summary statistics of the dataset.
```

✅ Try It Yourself:

* Create a section, figure, and code chunk using the `penguins` data
* Give each one a label
* Add a sentence that references each one

## 🚫 Part 2: Ignoring Files with `.gitignore`

When using Git, you often don’t want to track certain files (e.g., temporary files, data, or system files). That’s where `.gitignore` comes in!

---

### 🗂️ 1. What is `.gitignore`?

A `.gitignore` file tells Git **what to ignore** — Git will pretend these files don’t exist.

Example contents of `.gitignore`:

```
.Rproj.user
*.html
*.csv
.DS_Store
```

This would ignore:

- RStudio project files
- All `.html` and `.csv` files
- macOS system files

---

### 🛠️ 2. Create and Use `.gitignore`

1. In your project folder, create a file called `.gitignore`
2. Add the files or patterns you want Git to ignore
3. Save the file
4. Add a CSV file to your project folder
5. Check what Git sees:

```bash
git status
```

✅ If the ignored files aren’t listed, `.gitignore` is working.

---

### ⚠️ Important Note

If you already added a file to Git *before* putting it in `.gitignore`, Git will still track it.

To stop tracking it:

```bash
git rm --cached filename.csv
```

Then commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Stop tracking filename.csv"
```

---

## ✅ Summary

- Use `.gitignore` to keep your Git repository clean
- Avoid committing files like datasets, HTML outputs, or IDE settings
- Helps keep collaboration and version control simple

🎉 Great job — your Git repo is now cleaner and more professional!

# 📦 Mini Exercise: Using `git stash`

Sometimes you make changes in your working directory, but you're not ready to commit them — and you need to switch branches or pull updates. `git stash` lets you save your changes temporarily without committing.

---

## 🛠️ Goal

Learn how to:
- Save changes using `git stash`
- Switch branches safely
- Reapply your stashed work

---

## 🧪 Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Make sure you're inside a Git-tracked project (any project will do).

2. Open a file and make **some changes** — but **don’t commit** yet.

3. Check your Git status:

```bash
git status
```

You should see the file listed as modified.

---

### 📦 1. Stash Your Changes

Run:

```bash
git stash
```

✅ This saves your changes and returns your working directory to a clean state.

---

### 🔄 2. Switch Branches (or Pull)

Now try switching to another branch:

```bash
git checkout main
```

Or do a pull:

```bash
git pull
```

✅ Your working directory stays clean — no conflicts!

---

### ♻️ 3. Reapply the Stash

When you're ready to bring back your changes:

```bash
git stash apply
```

✅ Your edits will be restored to the files you changed.

---

### 🗑️ 4. (Optional) Clear the Stash

After applying, you can remove the stash:

```bash
git stash drop
```

Or, to both apply *and* drop in one step:

```bash
git stash pop
```

---

## ✅ Try It

1. Modify a file  
2. Run `git stash`  
3. Switch branches  
4. Return to your branch and run `git stash apply`  
5. Confirm your changes are back  
6. Commit if needed!

---

🎉 You’ve learned how to pause your work safely and come back to it later!
