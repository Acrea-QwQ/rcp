## `r emo::ji("target")` Objectives

* Learn to use `git lfs` to deal with large files
* Create licenses in our repostiroies
* Use `renv` to create a local library



## Lightweight dependency management using `renv`

Inside your repo from the previous section:

1. Create a qmd file that has a libraries code chunk, and load the `dplyr` and `ggplot2` libraries.

2. Stage the changes, commit and push.

3. What are the library paths for this project?

::: {.unilur-solution}
```
.libPaths()
"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.0/Resources/library"
```
:::

4. Install the `renv` package

5. Initialise `renv` in your R seession

::: {.unilur-solution}
`renv::init()`
:::

6. What new files or folders have been made in your repo with this command?

::: {.unilur-solution}
There is a new folder called `renv`, a new file called `.Rprofile` and a new filed called `renv.lock`.
:::

7. Using the terminal, use `cd` and `ls` to find the new files.

8. In the terminal, check the status of your repo.

::: {.unilur-solution}
![](../images/renv_init_files.png){fig-align="center"}
:::

9. Create a snapshot of your repostiory using `renv::snapshot()`

10. Check the status of your repo, stage, commit and push the changes into the remote repository.

::: {.unilur-solution}
```
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Adding renv files for dependency management"
git push origin main
```
:::

**Extension:** Try adding a development package from GitHub, such as the [`naniar`](https://github.com/njtierney/naniar) package. Follow the `renv` workflow. Does the package get recorded? Can you see it in the lockfile? How is it recorded differently from packages on CRAN?
